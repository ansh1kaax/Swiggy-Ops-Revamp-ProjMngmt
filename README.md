# Swiggy Operational Revamp – Sprint Simulation Project

This project simulates a real-world operational redesign for Swiggy, carried out using Agile methodologies. The goal was to streamline delivery workflows, improve cross-functional coordination, and implement process-level improvements via structured sprints.

I took on the role of a Project Manager (and cross-functionally as Product and Ops Manager) to lead documentation, backlog refinement, sprint planning, and execution using tools like Jira, Trello, and Slack.
